        JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, 
        is a programming language that is one of the core technologies 
        of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 
        As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side 
        for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. 
        All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine 
        to execute the code on users' devices.
